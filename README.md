Pouch is an app for your note taking needs

Pouch is a hobby project from my college days. I wrote Pouch to test my understanding of [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/). Being a hobby project, Pouch is very bare bones. You're welcome to browse the codebase and try the app, however I recommend using a real note taking app like [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) etc. for your note taking needs.

## Installation

Run the following commands in your terminal

```
mkdir ~/code
cd ~/code
git clone git@github.com:nisanth074/pouch.git
cd pouch
npm install
npm install -g coffee
npm install -g bower
bower install
npm install -g grunt
gem install compass
grunt
coffee app.coffee
```

and then visit [localhost:9393](http://localhost:9393/)

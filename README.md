## The story behind Pouch

I built Pouch in my junior year when there weren't many note taking apps around. I built it to solve my own note taking needs and to test my understanding of [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) (These frameworks had just been released then and Single Page Applications were at their nascency). I used Pouch to manage my notes, todos and bookmarks in the years that followed. It even got me my first job ðŸ˜‰

## How do I install it?

Run the commands below in your terminal

```
mkdir ~/code
cd ~/code
git clone git@github.com:nisanth074/pouch.git
cd pouch
npm install
npm install -g coffee
npm install -g bower
bower install
npm install -g grunt
gem install compass
grunt
coffee app.coffee
```

and visit [localhost:9393](http://localhost:9393/)

## Should I use Pouch?

No.

Thanks for considering using it though. While Pouch is very useful, its bare bones. They are many mature note taking apps available today. I recommend [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com).
